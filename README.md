# XPH16
Hackathon Xilinx Pynq

***Tech it easy***

![](https://github.com/GiadaColella/XPH16/blob/master/logo.jpg)

Hello everyone! We are glad to introduce you to the devide that we've just implemented.
In this code we will recognize the levels of stress of a person using the GPR sensor and the ZYBO board.
We will use the samples to plot a graphic that shows the trend of stress (even when you are listening to some relaxing music!)
The code is written in Python.


###Contents:

* ***Techiteasy_project*** is the file that contains the code.
* ***Salvataggio*** is the file that contains the code to save an audio file. 
* ***audiorelax1*** is an audio file. You can use it to run and try the code.

###Getting started:
* Make sure you have a ZYBO board, a GSR-sensor, and a double Headphone jack
* Download the code and enjoy! (we used jupyter)
